Nightmare : Among Shadows 

Fear is a machine,

A machine the likes of no man signals off shore in the Atlantic a call ...
an ode to a man of constant sorrow, as if fate called for it or things far worse .... 
A world opens up beyond our own ... one lurking and living with us for far to long ... Among Shadows ...

William wakes to a cold sweat bound by recurring dreams of slain beasts 
sewn together with yarn and barb a flicker in the darkness surrounded by foul sights and decaying beauty, 
a voice spurts through the static of the television my name is Ozymandias, Welcome ...

... A plane reported hijacked crashes in the Atlantic ...

Someone must die ... someone must be fed ... to quench the hunger of evil

Nightmare is a two part side by side horror story that is strung together to deliver a unique and terrifying narrative 
with the inclusion of randomly generated content and free DLC.

Nightmare features a collection of expanding and developing stories inside a newly crafted universe
that reflects tropes and parodies of our own to be its own unique and satisfying experience.
